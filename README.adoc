Ripcord binary patcher

== What does this do?
Patches Ripcord to allow for extra functionality.
Currently has patches that allow you to:

* See deleted messages
* Send messages in channels with a cooldown enabled
  Side note: The patch won't tell you how long you need to wait until you can send messages. Attempting to send messages when you're not supposed to could trip Discord's anti-spam system, though I've done it myself enough times to where I feel it's not a massive risk. *You've been warned.*

Adding features that require more than changing a few bytes is not in the scope of this project.

== Supported platforms
Windows and Linux, though the latter won't get updated as quickly.

== Supported versions
Windows: `0.4.29`
Linux: `0.4.29`
This doesn't use pattern matching, so I have to manually update every time a new Ripcord version is released. It's usually updated within 12 hours of a new release, but I can't guarantee anything.
