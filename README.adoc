Ripcord binary patcher

== What does this do?
Patches Ripcord to allow for extra functionality.
Currently has patches that allow you to:

* See deleted messages
* Send messages in channels with a cooldown enabled

Adding completely new features is not in the scope of this project.

== Supported platforms
Windows is the only one I make sure always works, as it's the platform I usually use.
I will occasionally test the Linux patches, however I can't assure you that they'll always work.
macOS is "supported", as in I've tried to make it work. I don't own a Mac, nor do I have a Hackintosh VM to test on.

== Supported versions
Only works on 0.4.27, although you can go back a few commits if you want to use older versions.
This doesn't use pattern matching, so I have to manually update every time a new Ripcord version is released. It's usually updated within 12 hours of a new release, but I can't guarantee anything.
